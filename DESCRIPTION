Description: This package contains functions to generate random samples from 
  truncated univariate and multivariate normal distributions subject to linear
  inequality constraints. Random generation from the truncated 
  multivariate Student-t distribution is also available. Please refer to 
  Li & Ghosh (2015) for details.
